Design a modern and playful UI style guide for a mobile app about dog adoption called "Adopttoutou". 
Focus on warm, friendly, and fun vibes with a professional finish. 

- Color palette: soft pastel backgrounds (beige #FAF9F6, light gray #F5F5F5), accent colors like playful orange (#FF914D), friendly violet (#7C4DFF), and natural green (#81C784). 
- Typography: round and modern fonts (Poppins Bold or Baloo for titles, Nunito or Roboto for body text). 
- Shapes: rounded corners everywhere (buttons, cards, containers), soft shadows for a card-like effect. 
- Iconography: cute and playful, using paw prints 🐾, bones 🍖, and houses 🏠 in flat or cartoon style. 
- Buttons: large, rounded, colorful, with fun text like “🐾 Join the Toutou World” or “Adopt Me”. 
- Overall style: clean, spacious layout, playful but not childish, like a mix of modern Material Design and a pet-themed brand. 

Output: a design system with example buttons, cards for dog profiles, and color/typography guidelines.
